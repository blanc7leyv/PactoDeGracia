<h2><p><b>Who is Jesus Christ?</b></p> </h2>
<div>
<p> Many people have more or less a concept of who Jesus is or what he has done.
He is known by some as a prophet, others recognize Him as a healer, and and others consider him as a historical figure.
According to John 1:1-3, Jesus existed from the beginning.
 From the beginning, Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God.
 Here, the Bible establishes the inseparable nature of Jesus and the God of the Universe.
John 1:14, Jesus became flesh and made His dwelling among us.
Why is His humanity so important?
In Hebrews 4:15, Jesus was tempted in every way, just as we are.
As such, he can sympathize with our weakness as humans.
What can we learn from the way he handled temptation?
According to 1 John 3:5, Jesus came to earth in human form so that He could die a physical death and take away our sins.
Romans 3:23 says everyone has sinned and is far away from God's saving presence.

<h3>What can you do to be saved?</h3>
<div>
<p> To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord, while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life.
This confession of Christ as Lord assumes that it is Christ who will work and fulfill His own righteousness within man, as man is unable to attain righteousness of his own accord.
Jesus calls this experience the “new birth.” He told Nicodemus: “. . . Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God” ( Jn. 3:3 ).
We invite you now to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour. “But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name” ( Jn. 1:12 ).

<h4>Invitation for Jesus to enter your life</h4>
<div>
<p>Dear Lord Jesus, I realize that I am a sinner and have broken your laws.
I understand that my sin has separated me from you. I am sorry and I ask you to forgive me.
 I accept the fact that your son Jesus Christ died for me, was resurrected, and is alive today and hears my prayers.
I now open my heart’s door and invite Jesus in to become my Lord and my Saviour.
I give Him control and ask that He would rule and reign in my heart so that His perfect will would be accomplished in my life.
In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
Congratulations!
If you prayed this prayer in all sincerity, you are now a Child of God. However there are a few things that you need to do to follow up on your commitment.
Get baptized ( full immersion) in water as commanded by Christ
Tell someone else about your new faith in Christ.
Spend time with God each day through prayer and Bible reading
Seek fellowship with other followers of Jesus
